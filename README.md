Module 8 Journal

•	Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

This goal of this project was for the user to test how their investments would grow over time. The user was to be able to input an initial investment amount, the amount they would deposit monthly, the annual interest rate, and number of years they would like to invest. After inputting this information, the program would provide two tables showcasing the year end balance and year end earned interest over the specified number of years with and without the user’s monthly deposit.  For this project, I was also required to create pseudocode to show how I was going to build the program and I was to follow the standards that were required of the client Airgead Banking. 

•	What did you do particularly well?

I did well with the layout of the menu that the user interacted with the tables that output to the user once they input the required information. I also did well with utilizing a class and organizing the code to be easily read and understood. I also did well with following the client’s, Airgead Banking, coding development standards.

•	Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

I could separate the cosmetic functions, such as the main menu of the program, from the program functions, the output tables. This would make my program be more manageable and organized. 

•	Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?

The piece of code that was found to be the most challenging was trying to output the correct end year balance and earned interest with a monthly deposit. I had used the formula provided in the functional requirements for this project, but it kept outputting the wrong amounts. I had to look up alternative equations to try to get the expected numbers. I tried a few different methods that I had found online before finding the one that worked the best. 

•	What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?

The skills that can be transferred to other projects or course work would be the use of classes and pseudocodes, following an industry’s standards for the format that they want the code to be, and utilizing object-oriented programming principles. 

•	How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

Utilizing a class and organizing the defined elements made my program very easy to read. Each defined element is its own folder, which makes it easily accessible which helps make the program adaptable and maintainable.
